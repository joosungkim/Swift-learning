### Coding Style
In any `UI Objects`, we mostly used `lazy var`. <br/>
`setUI` & `setConstraints` function will be used to set all

### File System
All images/ resources put in the folder `assets.xcassets`,


## **Conclusion**
Today marked the second day of Swift learning for myself. <br/>
Continous study in programmatic UI, instead of using `Storyboard` or `SwiftUI`. <br/>
Now there are multiple views that I'm able to connect and move between. There will be more progress to come and to get to an actual junior swift developer level. <br/>
I will try my first practice app on my own to create a simple app tomorrow.
