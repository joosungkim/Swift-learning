## **`UITableView`**
Basic list style cells that are listed in a container style with infinite scrolling. <br/>
### Coding structure  
In its instantiation, tableview will need `frame:CGRect.zero, style:.plain` in its declaration. <br/>
For all the cells it uses, they need to be registered to the view itself, as well as delegate and data source. <br/>
View Controller of the tableview will be implementing these two as well. <br/>
It will need to extend the functions to handle sectioning and indexing of cells. <br/>
The sections are parallel to first letters of phone contacts we use.  <br/>

## **`UICollectionView`**
The most used view type in modern iOS programming. <br/>
Unlike the `tableview`, it does not conform to one orientation, size, or structure. <br/>
Freedom to its configuration of shapes and sizes allow programmers to design and make more useful functions.
### Coding structure




## **Conclusion**
I need to learn how to make data access object in the to do list, as it will communicate between views. <br/>
